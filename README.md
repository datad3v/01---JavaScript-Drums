# 01---JavaScript-Drums
A JavaScript audio player application built as my JS30 Day challenge.
Goal of this - while originally used for drum sounds - tweaked the audio files to correspond to freely available files found in Youtube Audio Library. 

What I learned:

-Develop a quick key interface within the html file using css styling.
-Implemented functionality to the UI: to playSound according to key selected, animate CSS styling/removeTransition after key press and used eventListeners.
